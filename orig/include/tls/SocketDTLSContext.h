 *
 * Manages OpenSSL SSL_CTX objects for DTLS with socket library integration.
 * Provides secure defaults (DTLS 1.2 minimum, modern ciphers), certificate
 * loading, cookie-based DoS protection, and session caching.
 *
 * Features:
 * - DTLS 1.2 enforcement for forward secrecy and security
 * - Modern cipher suites (ECDHE + AES-GCM/ChaCha20-Poly1305)
 * - Cookie exchange for DoS protection (RFC 6347)
 * - Certificate verification with CA loading and hostname validation
 * - ALPN protocol negotiation support
 * - Session resumption via cache for performance
 * - MTU configuration for UDP path optimization
 * - Non-blocking compatible configuration
 * - Exception-based error handling with detailed OpenSSL error messages
 *
 * Thread safety Contexts are not thread-safe for modification after creation.
 * Share read-only after full setup, or use per-thread contexts.
 * SSL objects created from context are per-connection and thread-safe.
 *
 * Platform Requirements:
 * - OpenSSL 1.1.1+ or LibreSSL with DTLS support
 * - POSIX threads (pthread) for thread-safe error reporting

 * of SYN floods). When enabled on a server context, upon receiving a
 * ClientHello, the server generates a cryptographically signed cookie (using

 * allocating server-side handshake state. The client must include the cookie
 * in its second ClientHello to prove reachability (round-trip validation),
 * preventing resource exhaustion from spoofed IPs.
 *
 * This adds one extra round-trip to successful handshakes (increased latency
 * ~1 RTT) but drastically reduces server memory/CPU usage under attack.
 * Cookies are short-lived and stateless on server side until valid handshake
 * proceeds.
