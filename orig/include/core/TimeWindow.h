/**
 * @file TimeWindow.h
 * @ingroup foundation
 * @brief Sliding time window for rate measurement and event counting
 *
 * Provides a time-based sliding window counter that smoothly interpolates
 * between the current and previous window periods. This creates a more
 * accurate rate measurement compared to fixed time windows.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Automatic window rotation when period expires
 * - Linear interpolation between current and previous counts
 * - Weighted effective count calculation
 * - Configurable window duration
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 * @code{.c}
 *   TimeWindow_T window;
 *   int64_t now_ms = get_current_time_ms();
 *
 *   // Initialize with 60-second window
 *   TimeWindow_init(&window, 60000, now_ms);
 *
 *   // Record events
 *   TimeWindow_record(&window, now_ms);
 *
 *   // Get effective count (interpolated)
 *   uint32_t count = TimeWindow_effective_count(&window, now_ms);
 *
 *   // Reset if needed
 *   TimeWindow_reset(&window, now_ms);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see SocketSYNProtect for usage example in rate limiting
