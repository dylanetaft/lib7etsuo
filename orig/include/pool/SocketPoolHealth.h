/**
 * @file SocketPoolHealth.h
 * @brief Active health checking and circuit breaker for connection pools.
 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 *
 * Provides production-grade resilience patterns for SocketPool:
 * - **Per-host Circuit Breaker**: Tracks failures per host:port endpoint,
 *   automatically blocking connections to unhealthy backends.
 * - **Background Health Probes**: Periodically validates idle connections
 *   without blocking pool operations.
 * - **Custom Health Callbacks**: Application-defined probe logic executed
 *   from the background thread.
 *
 * Circuit Breaker State Machine:
 * @code
 *                      failures >= threshold
 *     [CLOSED] ─────────────────────────────────> [OPEN]
 *         ^                                          │
 *         │                                          │ reset_timeout
 *         │ probe success                            │ elapsed
 *         │                                          v

 * @endcode
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * // Configure health checking
 * SocketPoolHealth_Config config;
 * SocketPoolHealth_config_defaults(&config);
 * config.failure_threshold = 3;
 * config.probe_interval_ms = 5000;
 *
 * // Enable on existing pool
 * SocketPool_enable_health_checks(pool, &config);
 *
 * // Optional: custom probe callback
 * SocketPool_set_health_callback(pool, my_probe_func, user_data);
 *
 * // Check before connecting
 * if (SocketPool_circuit_allows(pool, "api.example.com", 443)) {
 *     // Safe to connect
 * }
 *
 * // Report connection outcomes
 * if (connection_succeeded)
 *     SocketPool_circuit_report_success(pool, host, port);
 * else
 *     SocketPool_circuit_report_failure(pool, host, port);
 *
 * // Cleanup happens automatically in SocketPool_free()
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All functions are thread-safe.
 * - Circuit state reads use lock-free atomics for fast path.
 * - Health probe callback is invoked WITHOUT pool mutex for blocking probes.
 *
 * Memory Management:
 * - Health subsystem uses pool's arena for allocations.
 * - No explicit cleanup required (handled by SocketPool_free()).
 *
 * @see SocketPool_T for connection pool.
 * @see SocketReconnect_T for per-connection circuit breaker.

 * @brief Health probe callback type.

 * @param pool       The connection pool (read-only).
 * @param conn       Connection to probe (do not modify pool state).

 * @param data       User data from SocketPool_set_health_callback().

 * Thread Safety Requirements:
 * - Callback is invoked from background thread, NOT main thread.
 * - Pool mutex is NOT held - safe to perform blocking I/O.
 * - MUST NOT call SocketPool_add/remove/get (undefined behavior).
 * - MUST NOT modify connection state directly.
 * - MAY read connection info via Connection_* accessors.
 * - MAY perform blocking network operations (up to timeout_ms).
 *
 * Implementation Guidelines:
 * - Use poll/select with timeout for socket operations.
 * - Check for graceful close (recv returns 0).
 * - Send application-level ping if protocol supports it.
 * - Return 0 on any error or timeout to mark unhealthy.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * int my_probe(SocketPool_T pool, Connection_T conn,
 *              int timeout_ms, void *data) {
 *     int fd = Connection_socket(conn);

 *     if (pfd.revents & (POLLERR | POLLHUP | POLLNVAL))
 *         return 0;  // Connection broken
