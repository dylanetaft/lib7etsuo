 * - SocketPool (pooling): Connection pooling with automatic lifecycle
 * management
 * - SocketReconnect (reconnection): Auto-reconnection with circuit breaker
 * - SocketRateLimit (rate-limit): Token bucket rate limiting
 * - SocketSYNProtect (syn-flood): SYN flood protection

/**
 * @file SocketPool.h
 * @brief Connection pooling with automatic lifecycle management.
 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 *
 * Manages a pool of socket connections with associated buffers and
 * metadata. Provides O(1) connection lookup using hash tables and
 * automatic cleanup of idle connections.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Pre-allocated connection slots for predictable memory usage
 * - Hash table for O(1) socket lookup
 * - Automatic idle connection cleanup
 * - Per-connection input/output buffers
 * - User data storage per connection
 * - Dynamic resize and pre-warming for performance
 * - Rate limiting and SYN flood protection
 * - Graceful shutdown (drain) support
 * - Auto-reconnection capabilities
 *
 * The Connection_T type is opaque - use accessor functions to
 * access connection properties.
 *
 * Thread Safety: All operations are thread-safe via internal mutex.
 * The pool can be used from multiple threads simultaneously.
 *
 * PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS:
 * - POSIX-compliant system (Linux, BSD, macOS)
 * - POSIX threads (pthread) for mutex synchronization
 * - NOT portable to Windows without pthreads adaptation
 *
 * @see SocketPool_new() for pool creation.
 * @see SocketPool_add() for connection registration.
 * @see Connection_T for connection accessors.
 * @see @ref event_system for event-driven I/O integration.
 * @see @ref core_io for underlying socket primitives.

 * @return Non-zero if connection is valid for reuse, 0 to remove it (forces
 * removal from pool).
 *
 * Called during SocketPool_get() before returning the connection to the
 * caller. If returns 0, the connection is automatically removed from the pool
 * and NULL is returned to the caller.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY NOTES:
 * The pool mutex is RELEASED before invoking this callback and re-acquired
 * after it returns. This prevents deadlock but has important implications:
 *
 * - MAY safely call SocketPool_add/remove/get on OTHER sockets (not conn)
 * - MAY safely read via Connection_* accessors (thread-safe)
 * - MAY perform I/O operations like poll(), recv(MSG_PEEK), etc.
 * - SHOULD complete reasonably quickly (degrades get() latency for caller)
 *
 * RACE CONDITIONS:
 * Because the mutex is released, the connection may be concurrently removed
 * by another thread while validation runs. The pool handles this safely:
 * - After callback returns, pool re-validates that conn still exists
 * - If conn was removed, the return value is ignored (connection gone)
 * - The Connection_T pointer passed to callback remains valid during the call
 *
 * WARNING: Do NOT cache the Connection_T pointer beyond the callback return.
 * After returning, the connection may be removed and the pointer invalidated.
 *
 * Use for application-specific health checks beyond built-in validation.
 *
 * @see SocketPool_set_validation_callback() for registration.
 * @see SocketPool_check_connection() for built-in health checks.
