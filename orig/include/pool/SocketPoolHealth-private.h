/**

 * @brief Private implementation details for health checking subsystem.
 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 * @internal
 *
 * NOT FOR PUBLIC USE - Internal header for SocketPool-health.c.
 * Defines internal structures for circuit breaker hash table and
 * background health worker thread.
 *
 * KEY COMPONENTS:
 * - struct SocketPoolCircuit_Entry: Per-host circuit breaker state
 * - struct SocketPoolHealth_T: Health subsystem context with worker thread
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * - Circuit state reads use atomic operations (lock-free fast path)
 * - Circuit state writes protected by circuit_mutex
 * - Worker thread signaling via worker_mutex + worker_cond
 * - Lock hierarchy: pool->mutex > circuit_mutex > worker_mutex
 *
 * MEMORY:
 * - All allocations from pool's arena (no manual free)
 * - Circuit entries allocated on demand, never freed (arena cleanup)
 *
 * @warning Direct use from application code undefined.
 * @see SocketPoolHealth.h for public API.
