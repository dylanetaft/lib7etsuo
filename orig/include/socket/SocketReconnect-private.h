 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 * @internal
 * @brief Internal structures and utilities for reconnection logic.
 *
 * Contains opaque type definitions, internal enums, and utility functions
 * used exclusively by the SocketReconnect implementation.
 *
 *  Internal Architecture Overview
 *
 * The private API supports the public reconnection framework through:
 *
 * - State tracking in SocketReconnect_T (timers, counters, error state)
 * - Circuit breaker logic with internal states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
 * - Time utilities using monotonic clocks
 * - Jitter calculation for backoff variability
 *
 * ```
 * Public API (SocketReconnect.h)
 *           |
 *           | uses
 *           v
 * +-------------------------+
 * | SocketReconnect-private.h|
 * +-------------------------+
 * | - SocketReconnect_T     |
 * | - CircuitState enum     |
 * | - time/random helpers   |
 * +-------------------------+
 *           |
 *           | implements
 *           v
 * SocketReconnect.c (internal functions)
 * ```
 *
 *  Module Relationships
 *
 * - **Depends on**: Foundation (Arena, Except, SocketUtil, SocketCrypto)
 * - **Used by**: SocketReconnect.c implementation only
 * - **Exposes**: No public symbols; internal use only
 *
 *  Key Internal Components
 *
 * | Component | Purpose | Thread Safety |
 * |-----------|---------|---------------|
 * | SocketReconnect_T | State and config storage | No (single-threaded access)
 * | | CircuitState | Internal circuit breaker FSM | Internal only | |
 * socketreconnect_* helpers | Time, random, elapsed calcs | Yes
 * (reentrant/static) |
 *
 *  Platform Requirements
 *
 * - POSIX with CLOCK_MONOTONIC for reliable timing
 * - Thread-local storage support (__thread or TLS)
 * - Optional: Cryptographic RNG for jitter (fallback to PRNG)

/**
 * @brief Internal circuit breaker states for reconnection resilience.
 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 * @internal
 *
 * Manages the circuit breaker pattern to prevent connection storms and
 * cascading failures during service outages. Provides three internal states
 * that map to public SocketReconnect_State behaviors but allow precise control
 * over transitions.
 *
 *  State Descriptions
 *
 * | State | Description | Behavior |
 * |-------|-------------|----------|
 * | CIRCUIT_CLOSED | Normal operation | Allows all connection attempts;
 * failures increment counters | | CIRCUIT_OPEN | Protection mode | Blocks
 * attempts after failure threshold; waits for reset timeout | |
 * CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN | Probe mode | Permits one probe connection; success
 * closes circuit, failure re-opens |
 *
 *  Transitions
 *
 * - CLOSED → OPEN: Consecutive failures reach policy.circuit_failure_threshold
 * - OPEN → HALF_OPEN: Timeout expires (policy.circuit_reset_timeout_ms)
 * - HALF_OPEN → CLOSED: Probe connection succeeds
 * - HALF_OPEN → OPEN: Probe fails
 * - CLOSED → CLOSED: Successful connections reset failure counters
 *
 * Transitions are atomic and handled internally by the state machine.
 *
 *  Usage
 *
 * Accessed only via SocketReconnect_T::circuit_state. Never set directly from
 * outside the module. Public API reflects these states through
 * SocketReconnect_State.
 *
 * @complexity O(1) for state checks and transitions
 * @threadsafe Internal - modifications protected by reconnect instance logic
 *
 * @note Resets to CLOSED on SocketReconnect_reset()
 * @warning Manipulating directly may cause inconsistent state or infinite
 * loops
 *
 * @see SocketReconnect_State for public state view
 * @see SocketReconnect_T::circuit_state for storage
 * @see SocketReconnect_Policy_T::circuit_failure_threshold configuration

/**
 * @brief Opaque internal context for reconnecting socket management.
 * @ingroup connection_mgmt
 * @internal
 *
 * Core data structure holding all configuration, state, timers, and resources
 * for a single reconnection instance. Supports exponential backoff with
 * jitter, circuit breaker pattern, periodic health checks, and automatic I/O
 * recovery.
 *
 *  Key Responsibilities
 *
 * - State machine transitions (connect, backoff, circuit states)
 * - Timer management (backoff delays, health intervals, circuit timeouts)
 * - Failure counting and retry limits
 * - Error logging and last-error tracking
 * - Resource ownership (arena, socket, callbacks)
 *
 *  Field Groups Overview
 *
 * | Group | Fields | Purpose |
 * |-------|--------|---------|
 * | Configuration | policy, host, port | Backoff policy and target endpoint |
 * | Resources | arena, socket | Memory and current connection handle |
 * | Callbacks | callback, health_check, userdata | Event notifications and
 * custom checks | | State | state, circuit_state | Current FSM and breaker
 * status | | Tracking | attempt_*, failures, successes | Metrics for retries
 * and reliability | | Timing | *_time_ms, backoff_until_ms, etc. | Monotonic
 * timestamps for scheduling | | Connection | connect_in_progress | Async
 * connect flags | | Errors | error_buf, last_error | Diagnostic information |
 *
 *  Lifecycle
 *
 * 1. **Creation**: SocketReconnect_new() allocates via arena, initializes
 * policy, copies host/port
 * 2. **Operation**: Public functions update fields atomically (e.g., connect
 * starts async, updates timers)
 * 3. **Destruction**: SocketReconnect_free() closes socket, disposes arena,
 * clears pointers
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - arena always valid until free
 * - socket NULL when not CONNECTED
 * - Timestamps use monotonic ms (non-decreasing)
 * - error_buf null-terminated, sized to SOCKET_RECONNECT_ERROR_BUFSIZE
 *
 *  Thread Safety
 *
 * @threadsafe No - Designed for single-threaded access from event loop
 * - All modifications via public API calls
 * - Internal helpers (time, random) are thread-safe
 * - Callbacks invoked from caller's thread context
 *
 *  Performance Notes
 *
 * - O(1) most operations (state checks, timer updates)
 * - Minimal allocations (arena-backed)
 * - Low memory footprint (~200-300 bytes + socket/arena)
 *
 * @complexity Varies by operation; generally O(1)
 * @note Host string copied to arena for lifetime management
 * @warning Direct field access undefined; use accessors where public
 * @note For leak detection, arena tracks all sub-allocs
 *
 * @see SocketReconnect_new() creation
 * @see SocketReconnect_free() destruction
 * @see SocketReconnect_Policy_T embedded policy
