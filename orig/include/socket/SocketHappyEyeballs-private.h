/**
 * @brief State enumeration for individual Happy Eyeballs connection attempts.
 * @ingroup async_io
 *
 * Defines discrete states tracking the lifecycle of a single parallel
 * connect(2) attempt within the RFC 8305 racing algorithm. Used to determine
 * readiness for I/O, winner selection, or cleanup. Transitions occur during
 * SocketHappyEyeballs_process() based on poll events, timeouts, and system
 * call results.
 *
 * State Progression:
 * - HE_ATTEMPT_IDLE: Initial state; attempt allocated but connect(2) not yet
 * called.
 * - HE_ATTEMPT_CONNECTING: Non-blocking connect(2) initiated; pending
 * completion signal.
 * - HE_ATTEMPT_CONNECTED: connect(2) succeeded (no error); socket ready for
 * use.
 * - HE_ATTEMPT_FAILED: Attempt aborted due to error, timeout, or cancellation.
 *
 * Transitions:
 * - IDLE → CONNECTING: When address selected and socket created/connect
 * started.
 * - CONNECTING → CONNECTED: Poll detects writability without error or
 * getsockopt(SO_ERROR)==0.
 * - CONNECTING → FAILED: Poll error, timeout expiry, or connect errno !=
 * EINPROGRESS.
 * - CONNECTED/FAILED → IDLE or destroyed: After winner selection or cleanup
 * phase.
 *
 * @note Only one transition per process() cycle per attempt for determinism.
 * @note FAILED state preserves specific errno in attempt::error for root cause
 * analysis.
 * @note No "PARTIAL" or TLS-specific states; focused on TCP connect phase
 * only.
 * @warning State races undefined if accessed concurrently outside owning
 * thread.

 * @brief Single connection attempt structure in Happy Eyeballs racing.

 *

 * - On failure/timeout: ::socket closed, ::error set, state to FAILED.
 * - Destroyed automatically via Arena_clear/dispose in owning context.
 *

 * leads to undefined behavior.
 * - All modifications protected by owning SocketHE_T's internal
 * synchronization (if implemented).
 *
 * Related Types and Functions:
 * - Integrated with SocketHE_T::attempts list and SocketHE_AddressEntry_T for

/**
 * @brief Wrapper structure for resolved addresses in Happy Eyeballs address

 *
 * Implements RFC 8305 §4.2 address sorting and interleaving logic: prefers
 * configured family (IPv6 default), tracks attempted addresses to avoid

 * iteration. Used internally to select next address for connection attempts
 * during racing phase.
 *
 * Lifecycle Management:
 * - Created from SocketDNS results during resolution phase in SocketHE_T.
 * - Sorted by family preference and address order (stable sort preserves DNS
 * order).
 * - ::tried flag updated when attempt starts for that address.
 * - List persists until operation completes or context freed; addresses freed
 * via freeaddrinfo() on ::resolved.
 *
 * Thread Safety Characteristics:
 * - No - internal structure; access serialized by owning SocketHE_T thread.
 * - List modifications (if any) protected internally.
 *
 * Related Types and Functions:
 * - Derived from struct addrinfo * in SocketHE_T::resolved.
 * - Used to populate SocketHE_Attempt_T::addr during racing.
 * - Interleaved via SocketHE_T::next_ipv6 / ::next_ipv4 pointers for
 * dual-stack racing.
 *
 * @note ::addr is borrowed from global resolved list; do not free
 * individually.
 * @note Sorting prefers IPv6 (default) but configurable via
 * SocketHE_Config_T::prefer_ipv6.
 * @note ::family extracted for quick filtering; matches ::addr->ai_family.
 * @note ::tried prevents re-attempting failed addresses in same operation.
 * @warning Modifying ::tried externally may cause duplicate attempts or skips.

/**
 * @brief Main opaque context for Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) dual-stack
 * connection racing.
 * @ingroup async_io
 *
 * Central orchestrator for the entire Happy Eyeballs algorithm: performs
 * asynchronous DNS resolution, sorts and interleaves resolved addresses per
 * family preference, launches parallel non-blocking connect(2) attempts,
 * monitors progress via poll integration, selects first successful connection
 * as winner, cancels/closes losers, and provides cleanup. Supports both
 * blocking synchronous mode (internal polling loop) and non-blocking
 * asynchronous mode with external event loop.
 *
 * What the Type Represents:
 * - State machine managing phases: IDLE → RESOLVING → (CONNECTING | FAILED |
 * CANCELLED) → CONNECTED.
 * - Resource owner for arenas, lists, sockets, timers during operation
 * lifetime.
 * - Integration point for SocketDNS_T (async DNS) and SocketPoll_T (event
 * multiplexing).
 *
 * Lifecycle Management:
 * - Created via SocketHappyEyeballs_start() (async) or internally in
 * SocketHappyEyeballs_connect() (sync).
 * - Advanced via SocketHappyEyeballs_process() calls in async mode or internal
 * loop in sync mode.
 * - Completed when SocketHappyEyeballs_poll() returns true (CONNECTED, FAILED,
 * or CANCELLED).
 * - Resources released via SocketHappyEyeballs_free() which cancels
 * in-progress ops if needed.
 * - Public API allocates via malloc(); internals use ::arena for zero-overhead
 * allocations.
 *
 * Thread Safety Characteristics:
 * - No - explicitly not thread-safe; all operations must occur from a single
 * thread (typically event loop thread).
 * - No internal locking; assumes exclusive access by caller.
 * - Multiple independent SocketHE_T instances may be used concurrently from
 * different threads.
 * - DNS callbacks execute in SocketDNS worker threads but synchronize back to
 * main thread via pollfd.
 *
 * Related Types and Functions:
 * - Configured via SocketHE_Config_T passed at creation.
 * - Manages lists of SocketHE_Attempt_T and SocketHE_AddressEntry_T.
 * - Integrates with Socket_T for connection primitives, SocketDNS_T for
 * resolution, SocketPoll_T for events.
 * - Error reporting via SocketHappyEyeballs_error() and SocketHE_Failed
 * exception.
 * - Timing via monotonic clocks; see SocketHE_T timing fields for details.
 *
 * @note Memory: Caller frees context via SocketHappyEyeballs_free(); owns
 * resulting socket from ::winner.
 * @note ::resolved owned; call freeaddrinfo() internally on cleanup - do not
 * access externally.
 * @note ::dns and ::poll borrowed unless ::owns_dns/::owns_poll set
 * (auto-create case).
 * @note State transitions atomic within process() but check
 * SocketHappyEyeballs_state() for current.
 * @note Error buffer ::error_buf formatted for SocketHappyEyeballs_error();
 * capacity SOCKET_HE_ERROR_BUFSIZE.
 * @warning Cancelling mid-operation closes sockets and aborts DNS; resources
 * reclaimed on free().
 * @warning Exceeding ::config.total_timeout_ms triggers FAILED state with
 * timeout error.
 * @warning In sync mode, blocks up to total_timeout_ms; use async for
 * responsive apps.
 *
 * @complexity Varies by phase:
 * - Init/resolution: O(n log n) for address sort where n=resolved addresses.
 * - Connecting: O(m) where m=attempts, each poll O(1) average.
 * - Overall: Efficient for small n/m (typical <10); scales with
 * config.max_attempts.
