 * @file SocketBuf.h
 * @ingroup core_io
 * @brief Circular buffer for efficient socket I/O operations.
 *
 * Provides efficient buffering for network I/O operations using a
 * circular buffer implementation. This minimizes memory copies and
 * provides O(1) operations for most buffer operations (O(n) for data copies).
 *
 * Features:
 * - Zero-copy read/write pointers for integration with system calls like
 * send/recv
 * - Dynamic resizing with SocketBuf_reserve()
 * - Secure clearing for sensitive data (e.g., keys, credentials)
 * - Thread-conditional safety with external synchronization
 * - Automatic wraparound handling - no manual offset management needed
 * - Arena-based memory management for efficient allocation/deallocation
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * #include "socket/SocketBuf.h"
 * #include "core/Arena.h"
 * #include <string.h>
 * #include <assert.h>
 *
 * Arena_T arena = Arena_new();
 * TRY {
 *     SocketBuf_T buf = SocketBuf_new(arena, 4096);
 *
 *     // Write data
 *     const char *msg = "Hello, SocketBuf!";
 *     size_t written = SocketBuf_write(buf, msg, strlen(msg));
 *     assert(written == strlen(msg));
 *     assert(SocketBuf_available(buf) == strlen(msg));
 *
 *     // Read data (copy)
 *     char readbuf[1024] = {0};
 *     size_t read_len = SocketBuf_read(buf, readbuf, sizeof(readbuf));
 *     assert(read_len == strlen(msg));
 *     assert(strcmp(readbuf, msg) == 0);
 *
 *     // Zero-copy read for transmission
 *     size_t len;
 *     const void *data_ptr = SocketBuf_readptr(buf, &len);
 *     if (data_ptr) {
 *         // e.g., send(socket, data_ptr, len, 0);
 *         SocketBuf_consume(buf, len);  // Remove after use
 *     }
 *
 *     SocketBuf_release(&buf);
 * } EXCEPT(SocketBuf_Failed) {
 *     // Handle errors: allocation failure, invalid ops
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Buffer error: %s\n", Except_message(Except_stack));
 * } FINALLY {
 *     // Release already called in TRY
 * } END_TRY;
 * Arena_dispose(&arena);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 *
 * For buffers holding sensitive data (e.g., TLS keys, passwords):
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * // Before reuse or disposal
 * SocketBuf_secureclear(buf);  // Overwrites with zeros
 *
 * // Or clear non-sensitive
 * SocketBuf_clear(buf);  // Faster, but leaves remnants
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Integrate with SocketPool_T for per-connection buffers in servers.
 * @warning Never retain pointers from readptr/writeptr across mutating calls.
 * @complexity Most ops O(1); data ops O(n) where n=bytes transferred.
 *
 * @see SocketBuf_new() for creation.
 * @see SocketBuf_write() / SocketBuf_read() for basic I/O.
 * @see Socket_readptr() / Socket_writeptr() for zero-copy patterns.
 * @see @ref connection_mgmt::SocketPool_T "SocketPool_T" for pool usage.
 * @see docs/ASYNC_IO.md for advanced I/O integration.
