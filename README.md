This is a restructuring of 7etsuo's tcurl library that attempts to modularize the codebase
and create separate components that can be used independently while avoiding namespace collisions
It is not complete at this time
I seriously doubt he would take a PR for this, but some boost-like library for C sounds cool 

Status:
- [x] Exception Library

Todo:
- [ ] Sockets 
- [ ] Review + break out protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS)
